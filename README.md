# Setting up a machine

If you have a machine with Visual Studio 2019, you can simply clone, open the solution, and run the tests.

If you don't have Visual Studio installed, you can see exactly how we set up a machine from scratch by opening the PowerShell script [machine-setup.ps1](machine-setup.ps1). Please note that this script calls other scripts via the `iwr` (`Invoke-WebRequest`) PowerShell command. You can run this and it will install everything you need on a completely clean machine, or you can pick and choose the pieces you want to install.
